For example, in the lower left quadrant, there is a region that is blue (5 - affected by layover) on 6/7/2021 but much of that area appear yellow (16 - affected by radar shadow) on 6/10/2021. This pattern is present throughout much of the scene with portions of area that are affected by layover in one acquisition in shadow in the next acquisition. This is not due to any real changes on the ground that occurred between the two acquisitions, rather it is the different viewing geometries of the orbital passes: one of the above scenes was collected during an ascending pass of the satellite and one during a descending pass. Since Sentinel-1 is always looking to the same side, ascending and descending passes will view the same area on the ground from opposing perspectives."

There are four north-facing glacier visible in the image, each with a lake at the toe. Bodies of water like lakes tend to appear dark in C-band SAR images because water is smooth with respect to the wavelength of the signal, meaning that most of the emitted signal is scattered away from the sensor. where surfaces that are rough at the scale of C-band wavelength, more signal is returned to the sensor and the backscatter image is brighter. For much more detail on interpreting SAR imagery, see the resources linked in the Sentinel-1 section of the [tutorial data](../../background/4_tutorial_data.md) page."
