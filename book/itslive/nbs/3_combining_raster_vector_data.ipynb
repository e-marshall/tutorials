    "In this notebook, we read a large object into memory and clipped it to the footprint of a single area of using a large vector dataframe, all the while managing coordinate reference system metadata of both objects. We then saved the clipped raster object to disk so that it can be easily re-used. The next notebook demonstrates exploratory data analysis steps using the object we just wrote to disk. "
